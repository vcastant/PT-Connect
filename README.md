## PT-Connect
Trainers can create, edit, or delete workouts. Patients (at least in first phase of development) will be able to see the entire list of workouts that the trainer creates. Patients will have Workout options based on the problem area, for example, If user chooses strength they will have options that are clickable and related to problem areas.


## Motivation
After a patient is discharged in physical therapy, PT patients don’t have a plan of action or system to keep them consistent in reaching their PT goals after discharge. As a result, there is regression in progress made for strengthening and mobility and PT patients find themselves. As a post physical therapy patient myself, with ongoing knee pain flare ups, I want to have a database of workouts approved by my trainer to continue a plan of action.This app give trainers the opportunity to update their workout plans. will also serve for tracking purposes and inputting new workouts.
