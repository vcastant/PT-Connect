## PT-Connect
Trainers can create, edit, or delete workouts. Patients (at least in first phase of development) will be able to see the entire list of workouts that the trainer creates. Patients will have Workout options that are split into stretch and strengthening routines based on their problem area. For example, If user chooses back pain, strength they will have options that are clickable and related to problem areas.


## Motivation
After a patient is discharged in physical therapy, many patiens are left with out a plan of action or system to keep them consistent in reaching their PT goals after discharge. As a result, there is regression in progress made in strengthening and mobility and PT patients find themselves excerabting injuries. As a post physical therapy patient myself, with ongoing knee pain flare ups, I want to have a database of workouts approved by my trainer to continue a plan of action.This app give trainers the opportunity to stay connected to their patients after therapy by updating workout plans and adding new ones to the database. The user/ patient will be able to use the app as pt therapy database, where they can find new workouts specific to their problem area, track completed excercie, and input new workouts to their plan.
